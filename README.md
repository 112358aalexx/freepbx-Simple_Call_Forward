FreePBX Simple Call Forwarding
==============================

This module creates two new feature codes intended to simplify the Call Forward process. One feature code allows the user to permanently store a destination phone number, and the other feature code is used to toggle unconditional call forward to that destination. A BLF hint is created using the toggle, so the user can have a visual indication that calls are being forwarded.

Ideal for the casual user that rarely or never changes the destination, just hit a single BLF button and calls are forwarded.
