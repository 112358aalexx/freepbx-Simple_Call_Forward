FreePBX Simple Call Forwarding
==============================

This 3rd party FreePBX module creates two new feature codes intended to simplify the Call Forward process. One feature code allows the user to permanently store a destination phone number, and the other feature code is used to toggle unconditional call forward to that destination. A BLF hint is created using the toggle, so the user can have a visual indication that calls are being forwarded.

Ideal for the casual user that rarely or never changes the destination, just hit a single BLF button and calls are forwarded.

To install:
* Download the latest version tarball from: http://pbxossa.org/files/simplecf/
* Upload the tarball in FreePBX Module Admin
* Scroll down the module list and Install Simple Call Forwarding
* Reload and navigate to Feature Codes to see the two new feature codes.
